# Which one is the best Pokemon of them all?

If you have ever played a Pokemon game, or even multiple, it is likely that you have wondered which one, of the many, is the best Pokemon. 
This question is quite obvious, because all the game is about is collecting better and better Pokemon to increase your battle strength, to eventually be so strong that you can defeat the bad guys who want to abuse Pokemon to gain power.

As I am a data scientist, this question is exciting, because it can be answered very precisely just from looking at all the available data.
Hope you enjoy!
