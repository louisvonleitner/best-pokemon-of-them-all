            If you have ever played a Pokemon game, or even multiple, it is
            likely that you have wondered which one, of the many, is the best
            Pokemon.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            This question is quite obvious, because all the game is about is
            collecting better and better Pokemon to increase your battle
            strength, to eventually be so strong that you can defeat the bad
            guys who want to abuse Pokemon to gain power.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            As I am a data scientist, this question is exciting, because it can
            be answered very precisely just from looking at all the available
            data.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>So let us dive straight into it!</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span></span>
        </span>
        <h1 class="home-text116">What is a good Pokemon?</h1>
        <span class="home-text117">
          <span>
            A good Pokemon has many qualities. Among others, there are its
            Battle Points, divided into different skills. But what can really
            give a Pokemon a big advantage in a fight, even if it has less
            Battle Points than the opposing Pokemon is attacking effectively and
            being attacked ineffectively. Even with a very high attack score of
            Battle Points, an attacker deals only mediocre damage (0.5x) if it
            is ineffective against the attacked Pokemon's PokeType. Vice versa,
            if a Pokemon attacks effectively, even with a low attack score of
            Battle Points, it can deal a lot more damage (2x).So, one could say
            that better Pokemon are more likely to face PokeTypes in a fight
            that are ineffective against it and which it attacks effectively
            itself. To measure this "more likely", we give a definition of the
            PokeType likelihood:
          </span>
          <br class="home-text119" />
          <span class="home-text120">
            The likelihood of a Pokemon facing a Pokemon of PokeType $T$ is the
            sum of catch rates of all Pokemon of that PokeType
          </span>
          <span>. In a formula, this is:</span>
          <br />
        </span>
        <span class="home-text123">
          $\textit{PokeType likelihood} = \sum_{p \in T} c_p,$
        </span>
        <span class="home-text124">
          where $T$ is the set of Pokemon of PokeType $T$ and $p \in T$
          signifies that $p$ is a Pokemon of said type. Further, $c_p := $
          Catchrate of Pokemon $p$.
        </span>
        <span class="home-text125">
          <span>
            We here assume that the probability of encountering a Pokemon is
            proportional to its catch rate. This assumption is intuitive as more
            rare Pokemon are usually have lower catch rates. The PokeType
            likelihood is thus a weighted sum over the set of all Pokemon of
            this PokeType. The weights being the catch rates.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            We will conduct the following data analysis on a dataset of all
            Pokemon in the Pokeverse, from Generations 1 to 6.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>What PokeTypes are good at what?</span>
        </span>

        <span class="home-text131">
          <span>We can clearly see that</span>
          <span class="home-text133">Steel</span>
          <span>
            is the PokeType with the most Opponents dealing less damage to it
            due to Type mechanics. However,
          </span>
          <span class="home-text135">Steel</span>
          <span>Pokemon do not naturally counter a lot of pokemon.</span>

          <span class="home-text141">Rock</span>
          <span>
            are ranked quite high in both counters and weak attackers with
          </span>
          <span class="home-text143">Fire</span>
          <span>seeming to be</span>
          <span>the best overall. But are they really the best PokeTypes?</span>
        </span>
        <h1 class="home-text146">
          Are Pokemon that deal more damage less resistant to others?
        </h1>
        <span class="home-text147">
          <span>
            The idea behind this question is simple. Usually, in games, the
            characters that deal more damage are also more endangered by other
            characters. This leads to a balancing between different classes of
            characters, because classes that deal less damage can absorb a lot
            of damage and protect the damage dealers in the team.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>Does this hold true for PokeTypes aswell?</span>
          <br />
        </span>
        <img
          alt="image"
          src="public/correlation%20countering-600h.png"
          loading="eager"
          class="home-image11"
        />
        <span class="home-text152">
          <span>
            This figure shows how a Pokemon's traits are when they counter a lot
            of other Pokemon. It clearly shows that Pokemon that counter a lot
            of other pokemon are also countered by a lot of other Pokemon. This
            means in general that Pokemon that deal a lot of damage also take a
            lot of damage and vice versa.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            However, there is no apparent relationship between Pokemon that
            counter a lot of other Pokemon and the amount of Pokemon that are
            ineffective against them (Color). So, even Pokemon that deal a lot
            of damage are not less likely to take reduced damage from other
            Pokemon.
          </span>
        </span>
        <h1 class="home-text157">What is the best PokeType?</h1>
        <span class="home-text158">
          <span>
            Even though it is clear to see that PokeTypes that counter more
            Pokemon also get countered by more Pokemon, the balancing is
            probably not perfect. Achieving perfect balancing would be a complex
            optimization task for 600 different Pokemon. This is where we can
            gain an edge over opponents, by using the PokeType that counters
            more opponents than it is countered by. For measuring this, it is
            intuitive to use the metric:
          </span>
          <br />
        </span>
        <span class="home-text161">
          score = number of pokemon countered - pokemon
        </span>
        <span class="home-text162">Here is the ranking of all PokeTypes:</span>
        <img
          alt="image"
          src="public/score-600h.png"
          loading="eager"
          class="home-image12"
        />
        <span class="home-text163">
          <span>
            It becomes very evident that based on this simple metric of
            comparing how likely it is to encounter a Pokemon of a specific
            PokeType,
          </span>
          <span class="home-text165">Electric</span>
          <span>is the best PokeType by far! The worst ones are</span>
          <span class="home-text167">Rock</span>
          <span>,</span>
          <span class="home-text169">Dragon</span>
          <span>and</span>
          <span class="home-text171">Grass</span>
          <span>. Therefore, we will look more into the</span>
          <span class="home-text173">Electric</span>
          <span>class to determine the best</span>
          <span class="home-text175">Electric</span>
          <span>Pokemon. This will then be the best Pokemon of them all!</span>
        </span>
        <h1 class="home-text177">What is the best Electro Pokemon?</h1>
        <span class="home-text178">
          <span>Within the best PokeType,</span>
          <span class="home-text180">Electro</span>
          <span>
            , there must be better and worse Pokemon. Luckily, it is relatively
            easy to measure how good a Pokemon is by looking at its total
            BattlePoints (BP). This is a sum of all of its characteristics
            points, like defense, attack and others. Therefore, the Pokemon with
            the most BP is the strongest one.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>Which one is it?</span>
          <br />
        </span>
        <img
          alt="image"
          src="public/electric_distribution_violin-600h.png"
          loading="eager"

        />
        <span class="home-text185">
          <span>
            We can see that Mega Ampharos has the highest score of battle
            points. However, its second PokeType is not within the 4 best ones.
            Therefore, one could argue that Zeraora is the best Pokemon because
            it is pure
          </span>
          <span class="home-text187">Electric</span>
          <span>
            and as we saw above should thus be the most effective and strong
            Pokemon of them all. It so happens that Mega Ampharos is actually a
            second type
          </span>
          <span class="home-text189">Dragon</span>
          <span>
            Pokemon, which is the second worst category by earlier's metric.
            Thus it is safe to say that for instance Zeraora is a better
            Pokemon. However, some Pokemon with secondary PokeType
          </span>
          <span class="home-text191">Flying</span>
          <span>
            are also close to the best Pokemon in terms of Battle Points.
            Naturally, the question arises wether it is beneficial to have
            secondary PokeType
          </span>
          <span class="home-text193">Flying</span>
          <span>for Electric Pokemon...</span>
        </span>
        <h1 class="home-text195">
          Is it better to have PokeType Electro Flying or pure Electro?
        </h1>
        <span class="home-text196">
          <span>If a Pokemon has second PokeType</span>
          <span class="home-text198">Flying</span>
          <span>, along with first PokeType</span>
          <span class="home-text200">Electro</span>
          <span>, it is exposed to more other effective Pokemon than pure</span>
          <span class="home-text202">Electro</span>
          <span>Pokemon. However, having</span>
          <span class="home-text204">Flying</span>
          <span>
            attack abilities can be very effective or at least effective on

          </span>
          <span class="home-text206">Electro</span>
          <span>attacks are ineffective against. Moreover,</span>

            On the other hand, the amount of pokemon effectively attacking such

            effective attacking and added resistance versus added danger from

            Pokemon listed above, Zapdos and Thundrus forms are the best Pokemon
            in the Pokeverse. To make a more detailed and solid statement about 
            the best Pokemon, one would have to analyse further. For example, it 
            would be interesting to explore how important the PokeType actually is. 
            This could be done by trying to give a multiplicator score that is 
            multiplied to a Pokemon's Battle Points, to better compare the strength 
            of Pokemon of differing PokeTypes. Good catching!
